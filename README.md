# Biztime

Biztime is a relatively simple app which uses Express and Postgres to create an API.  To use the app, first set it up using the following commands in the shell:

```BASH
psql < data.sql
npm install
```

After having done so, you can run the server using the following command:

```BASH
nodemon dist/server.js
```
